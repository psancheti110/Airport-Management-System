## Model Relational Database Management System

This example RDBMS is based on the scenario of a hypothetical airport based in Hyderabad.
The considerations, constraints and EER diagrams are provided in the prior documents. The database has been populated with some example values to demonstrate the working of functions. These values have been listed in `population.txt`.
The data stored can be queried and updated through `mysql`, and the functional requirements given in the earlier phases have been implemented with python to provide a simple CLI-based menu interface to run the queries.

**Instructions**

This is on the assumption that the user has already installed the MySQL client.

- Enter the folder
- Open the MySQL CLI
- run `source DNA_PROJECT.sql`
- Now close the MySQL CLI and run `python3 kode.py`

**Functional Requirements**

- View all out-going flights on a particular day
    - Takes a valid date value as input

- View all airlines with more than a given number of flights on a particular day
    - Takes a valid date value as input

- Show city with most incoming flights

- Display passenger details search using PASSPORT ID
    - Accepts a string to search for in the PASSPORT_ID set

- Display number of flights with below average number of passengers
    - Displays average number of passengers per flight and details of the required flights

- Show airline flying the highest number of minors

- Add a new passenger to a flight
    - Takes in PASSPORT_ID and other required details needed to make a reservation
    - Checks for flight availibility, luggage constraints, etc.
    - Creates the associated relations such as FLIES_ON, SUPPLIES_TO, etc.

- Update Meal Type:
    - On entering a valid passenger passport id, and preference of meal type and class, either existing meal is updated, or a new meal is created if not already present,
    - Meal preferences are limited to given options and are case insensitive.


- Delete passenger:
    - Deletes luggage , meal details of passenger as well as removes the passenger from its current flight provided passenger exists in database.
